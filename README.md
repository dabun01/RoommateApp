# 🧹 Responsible Roomies

Responsible Roomies is an iOS app designed to make shared living easier and more fun! The app helps roommates organize and manage household chores by turning them into a game.

Each roommate can:

* 📝 Create and assign chores for the house

* 🎯 Earn points for completing chores

* 🏆 Track rankings to see who’s pulling their weight

* 🎮 Compete or collaborate to keep the household running smoothly

The chores are gamified to promote fairness and motivation — no more arguing over dishes or taking out the trash. Responsible Roomies keeps everyone accountable while making housework engaging and rewarding.
